title: books to read

![Github Images](/images/books.jpg)

Books in themselves are representations.  So an image of books is like a representation of representations, a 'meta-representation' if you will.

The picture represents books on my desk. On another level, it represents ideas I want to explore through stories and poems and other kinds of writing, ideas that happen to be crossing my path at this time.  Each book tells a story, not just the story within its pages, but the story of how it came to be there, on my small shelf of 'to read' books.

 It can provoke in me feelings of regret that I am not making time to actually read them. It can also make me feel a kind of yearning, an acknowledgement of possibility, of new things to learn and experience.

It stirs memories of a life time of loving books and reading as well as the feel, smell, and experience of actual, physical books.  Along with that is some sadness that I don't read physical books much these days, and that most of my reading is done through digital formats.
