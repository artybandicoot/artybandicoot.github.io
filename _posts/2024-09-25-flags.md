I nearly skipped my art practice today.  I was intending to join a focus group during my lunch break and do a sketch, but was running late, didn't have my laptop to login online, and didn't have any ideas of what to draw. 

I faced a moment of decision. Should I sit down where I was, log in to the focus group on my phone and draw whatever was in front of me in the amount of time left that I had ... or ... spend the time quietly sitting, contemplating things and watching the world around me while I finished my lunch.   I opted to join the focus group and do a sketch. 

The accountability that results from knowing other people are showing up to do their practice, together with the feeling of connection I experience when I show up too, has made a huge difference in motivating myself to do my art practice. 

I'm currently doing a similar thing with my physical exercise, checking in my progress daily with particular friends and family members. 

One thing I am sure of - having accountability buddies works!
