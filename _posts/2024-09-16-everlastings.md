The Everlasting daisies are everywhere at the moment, embodying utter joy and aliveness.  I read a recent [post](https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/09/05/joy/) by Maria Popova on the paradox of joy.  It's along the lines of the contradiction inherent in the inseparability of joy and sadness and quotes [Kahlil Gibran](https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/kahlil-gibran/) -“Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.” 

I relate to this completely. Recently I was in the garden and was completely overawed by how beautiful at all was and was filled with an overwhelming feeling of joy.  I noticed that at the same time a feeling of sadness welled up in me like wave. There was an acute awareness of the transience and impermanence of things, and therein lies the poignancy - you can't have one without the other.  From a poem called 'Joy' by Lisel Mueller (also quoted by Popova). 

It’s about  
two seemingly parallel lines  
suddenly coming together  
inside us, in some place  
that is still wilderness.  
Joy, joy, the sopranos sing,  
reaching for the shimmering notes  
while our eyes fill with tears.
