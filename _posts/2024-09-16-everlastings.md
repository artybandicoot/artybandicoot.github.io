title: everlastings (and the paradox of joy)

The everlasting daisies are everywhere at the moment, embodying utter joy and aliveness.  I read a [post](https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/09/05/joy/) by Maria Popova recently on the paradox of joy.  She talks about the contradiction inherent in the inseparability of joy and sadness and quotes [Kahlil Gibran](https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/kahlil-gibran/) -“Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.” 

I relate to this completely. Recently I was in the garden and was completely overawed by how beautiful at all was and was filled with an overwhelming sense of joy.  At the same time a feeling of sadness washed through me me like wave. I felt acutely aware of the transience and impermanence of things.  Yet it's not necessarily about loss, as Lisel Meuller suggests in a poem called 'Joy' (also quoted by Popova): 

It’s about  
two seemingly parallel lines  
suddenly coming together  
inside us, in some place  
that is still wilderness.  
Joy, joy, the sopranos sing,  
reaching for the shimmering notes  
while our eyes fill with tears.
