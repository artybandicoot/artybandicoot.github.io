I've noticed a difference in my experience of doing my art practice between drawing on location, and working from a photo.  I'm not saying one is better than the other, just different, and I'm curious to explore the differences.  These observations are based on my practice over the past week or so, when I have done two art practices while sitting outside somewhere and drawing my surroundings. 

On location I tend to draw bigger pictures and use two pages of my sketchbook instead of the usual one page. I am more free flowing with the pen and work more quickly.  Also, I don't fuss as much about the colours.

It seems like there is more room to move but is difficult to control and contain.  There is more to draw so no time to overthink or focus on detail. The end result has an unfinished quality.  I could finish them with a bit more work, but in some ways I'm content to leave it wherever it gets to, to leave it unfinished.  
 
The main difference between the two ways of working is that being on location I am drawing 'actual reality' (if there is such a thing) as it happens.  It feels more immediate and directly connected to the experience created by the environment I am in.   When I am drawing from a photo, I am immersed in a memory. The experience itself can be just as intense, real or present as when on location, but I more easily focus on detail and exert more control over the process.

The difference can also be seen as a difference in intention.  When I'm drawing on location the intention is to capture the present moment, and when I am drawing from a photo the intention is to capture a moment from the past. 

Both seem perfectly fine to me.
