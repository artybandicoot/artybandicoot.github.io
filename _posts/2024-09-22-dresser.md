Over the last few days I haven't feel inspired to do any sketching, and couldn't think of or see anything around me that I wanted to draw.  Its a common problem for me.  

It's easy to give in to those feelings of resistance and there are always plenty of reasons to justify it.  Giving yourself a break from habits is actually supported by the science (according to researcher Tali Sharot whom I listened to on a [10% Happier podcast episode](https://www.happierapp.com/podcast/tph/tali-sharot)). I find when I push myself to stick to the habit no matter what, the enjoyment factor evaporates.   Again, self-compassion is easy to justify. 

On the other hand, it is worth examining what is behind the resistance.  I noticed that I was getting caught up in thinking about the end result rather than the process itself.  This seemed to add a few drops of anxiety into the mix and a pressured feeling that it needed to be an interesting subject matter or a 'good' picture.  A small thing, but seemingly enough to turn me off the path of actually doing the practice. 

It's difficult to know, sometimes, when giving yourself a break is useful or just a way to avoid a difficult feeling.
