title: garden circle (and why I do a daily sketch)

My daily sketches have felt pretty ordinary lately and I've not wanted to post them on the blog.  I posted them anyway, even though I don’t have to. Having days when I am not fully 'in the zone' is inevitable and perfectly normal.  However,  when it produces art that I don't connect with, it can end up feeling demotivating and discouraging. 

Thinking about this led me to consider why I want to do a daily sketch.   I was reminded of Thich Nhat Hanh's story about why he does the dishes.  Yes, he does the dishes to make them clean, but he also does the dishes to, well, do the dishes:

> Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end. We do the dishes not only in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them, and to be truly in touch with life.

It's circular logic *par excellence*.  I love circularity, the way it takes me back to where I started. Sometimes it's good to get off the straight and narrow path of linear logic, which seems to always be leading somewhere else, away from right here.  

So why am I doing a sketch each day?  To do a sketch each day.  But other answers are also good to think about, to help reconnect with the joy and inspiration I can feel when doing art.  
 
One of the main reasons I want to do art is to be able to practice paying attention to what I see, from a place of awareness, in order to experience the interconnectedness of essence and form. Thich Nhat Hanh expresses it thus:

> Each thought, each action in the sunlight of awareness becomes sacred. In this light, no boundary exists between the sacred and the profane.
