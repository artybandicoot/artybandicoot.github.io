title: zen garden (with a sprinkle of irony)

I went to a Japanese Zen garden today, anticipating that I would feel calm, relaxed, in flow and at one with the universe while I did my sketching practice.  Instead, largely because I chose to sit by the main thoroughfare, I felt distracted by the people walking past and self-conscious about drawing in public.  

This feeling was reflected in my art practice.  My lines felt less confident, and the scene I was drawing seemed too 'busy' and complicated to draw well in the short time I had, with too many details to pay attention to.  

The irony of the situation didn't escape me. 

The focus of my attention was controlled primarily by the idea of the subject matter I wanted to draw (the outcome). If I had immersed myself more fully in the experience itself and followed by intuition,  I would have only been concerned about the shapes, lines and colours that were reaching out to me.
