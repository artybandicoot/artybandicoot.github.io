The orange/red colours bled into the background too much. I don't mind a bit of that, but I was annoyed at making this 'mistake'. 

The wonderful thing about this daily art practice is that I have to accept my mistakes and see the practice and what it produces for what it really is - an experiment, a moment in time in which I learn something.  Accept it -  mistakes, mediocrity, and all.  Then let it go, move on and take the next step. 

The intention with my practice is to find 30 minutes each day to do something in my sketchbook. It doesn't matter what the outcome is, which feels very liberating. However I still need to deal with the feelings that arise from the experience, which includes how I respond to the outcome. These feelings could be anything from disappointment or frustration, to happiness, excitement or joy. The one constant I hope is always there, is curiosity.
