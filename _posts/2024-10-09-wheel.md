title: rusty wagon wheel (and the 'wheel of awareness')

I've just finished a book called 'Aware: The Science and Practice of Presence' by Dr. Dan Siegel.  He is the founder of the [Mindsight Institute](https://mindsightinstitute.com/), and in the book draws together a heap of fascinating research around neuroscience and mindfulness practice.

Using the metaphor of the wheel he has created a guided meditation called the [Wheel of Awareness](https://drdansiegel.com/wheel-of-awareness/).  

The rim of the wheel represents all the 'knowns' (the things we are conscious of) and is divided into four segments. The first segment contains all the things we experience through our five senses; the second segment contains the interior aspects of our body; the third segment contains all of our 'mental activity' (such as thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories) and the fourth segment contains our interconnectedness with other beings. 

The hub of the wheel represents the 'knowing' or awareness of the knowns.   There is also a single spoke, which represents our attention or focus.   

During the Wheel of Awareness meditation you are guided to give your attention to each of the four segments, moving the spoke to bring awareness to each one in turn.  In between focussing attention on the third and fourth sections of the rim, Dan invites you to turn the spoke back on itself, to face the hub and become aware of awareness itself.  In the book, in which he delves into physics to explore these concepts, he describes this state as the 'plane of possibility' where pure energy resides (in physics, energy is defined as the potential, capacity or ability to create change).

The aim of the practice is integration of consciousness, and from a neuroscience perspective, a greater integration of the different parts of the brain, which is good for our mental health and wellbeing. 

Although I have been aware of Dan Siegel's work for a while, it wasn't until I listened to Loch Kelly's conversation with Dan on this [podcast episode](https://lochkelly.org/podcasts/dr-dan-siegel-wheel-of-awareness-2), that I was spurred to read some of his work.  There is a lot of 'concilience' (a great word that Dan uses in the podcast which means a convergence or concordance of evidence from independent sources) between Loch's 'effortless mindfulness' approach and Dan's 'wheel of awareness'.  

I feel that the 'plane of possibility', the awareness of awareness itself, is energy that can manifest itself through making art and is akin to the 'flow' that many creatives experience when practicing their art.
