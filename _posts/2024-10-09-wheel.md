title: rusty wagon wheel (and the 'wheel of awareness')

I've been wanting to draw this old wheel for a while now.  It's been in our backyard since forever. It seemed like an opportune time given I have just finished a book about the 'wheel of awareness'. 

Th book is titled 'Aware: The Science and Practice of Presence' by Dr. Dan Siegel.  Dan is the founder of the [Mindsight Institute](https://mindsightinstitute.com/), and in the book draws together a heap of fascinating research around neuroscience and mindfulness practice.

Supported by this research, Dan has created a guided meditation called the [Wheel of Awareness](https://drdansiegel.com/wheel-of-awareness/) using the metaphor of the wheel to represent our consciousness.

The rim of the wheel represents all the 'knowns' (the things we are conscious of) and is divided into four segments. First, all the things we experience through our five senses; second, the interior aspects of our body;third,  all of our 'mental activity' (such as thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories) and fourth, our interconnectedness with other beings. 

The hub of the wheel represents the 'knowing' or awareness of the knowns.   There is also a single spoke, which represents our attention or focus.   

During the Wheel of Awareness meditation you are guided to give your attention to each of the four segments, moving the spoke to bring awareness to each one in turn.  In between focussing attention on the third and fourth sections of the rim, Dan invites you to turn the spoke back on itself, to face the hub and become aware of awareness itself.  In the book, in which he delves into physics to explore these concepts, he describes this state as the 'plane of possibility' where pure energy resides (in physics, energy is defined as the potential, capacity or ability to create change).

The aim of the practice is integration of consciousness.  From a neuroscience perspective, this translates to a greater integration of the different parts of the brain, which is good for our mental and physical health and wellbeing. 

Although I have been aware of Dan Siegel's work for a while, it wasn't until I listened to Loch Kelly's conversation with Dan on this [podcast episode](https://lochkelly.org/podcasts/dr-dan-siegel-wheel-of-awareness-2), that I was spurred to read some of his work.  There is a lot of 'concilience' (a great word that Dan uses in the podcast which means a convergence or concordance of evidence from independent sources) between Loch's 'effortless mindfulness' approach and Dan's 'wheel of awareness'.  

I feel that the 'plane of possibility', the awareness of awareness itself, is energy that can manifest itself through making art and is akin to the 'flow' that many creatives experience when practicing their art.
