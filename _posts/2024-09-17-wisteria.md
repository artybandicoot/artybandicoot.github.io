Scene from the corner of the house where the wisteria forms a purple canopy as it grows over some beams, draping itself and bursting out of its buds with so much aliveness.

It's always seems such a short flowering period, but I'm glad I can enjoy it everyday while it lasts.  Soon, perhaps in a few weeks when they are finishing up, it will start to snow purple petals.
