I cross this bridge quite often one of my regular walks near my house.  The sign always makes me smile, I don't know why.  There are horses in our area, which is kind of semi-rural, but I've never seen anyone riding a horse around here.

I find drawing natural environments difficult and not fun, which is a pity because there is so much of it around where I live.  I love to be among it all, I just don't like drawing it.  I drew this scene today because I liked the bridge and the sign, one of the few 'human made' objects on the walk. 

I can never seem to 'see the forest for the trees', by which I mean, when I'm drawing a nature scene I can't seem to discern the shapes and patterns from all the detail.  Nature seems complicated, and to my eye, a jumbly and complex mass of greens, greys and browns. (Except for flowers - they are colourful, interesting and very fun things to draw close up).  

I think if I paid more attention to tonal values and composition, was more adventurous with colour, and was more selective about what to include in the picture, I might have a better time with drawing the natural world around me.
